# Website Template

This Project is a template for website building and learning. I use this this template for rapid development of website projects and also showing students of web courses what these kind of layouts look like.

As best as possible, this template aims to conform to Web Standards as defined by https://www.w3.org

Everyone is free to use this template as they wish, if you wish to credit me for the initial work that would be nice but is not required. You can find my projects and work on GitHub and also follow me on Twitter and YouTube.
