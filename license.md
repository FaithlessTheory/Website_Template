External Links (Fonts, Styles and Scripts etc)
Links included in the template (for example to bootstrap and other external scripts have their own user agreements and license and as such consult with those if you intend to use them.) I intend to keep this updated as best i can (regarding the use of external scripts and styles) but to avoid issues ensure you check to make sure you comply with those bits and bobs.

As a general rule any external sources are open source and/or provided by the respective foundation/developer for free use.
